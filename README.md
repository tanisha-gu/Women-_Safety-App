# Women Safety App – Python Backend

## Overview

The Women Safety App backend is a Python-based system designed to support emergency safety features such as SOS alerts, live location tracking, emergency contact management, incident reporting, and AI-assisted safety functionalities.

The backend handles:

* User authentication
* Emergency SOS services
* Real-time location support
* Incident reporting
* Emergency contact management
* Data storage and retrieval
* AI-based assistance features

This project is structured using multiple Python modules for better maintainability and scalability.

# Installation Guide

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Women-_Safety-App-main
```

---

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux/Mac

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, manually install:

```bash
pip install flask requests pandas
```

---

# Running the Backend

## Run Main Application

```bash
python Main.py
```

OR

```bash
python server.py
```

---

# Docker Deployment

## Start Using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Stop Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

# API Workflow

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers/login
2. Credentials validated
3. Session/token generated
4. Access granted

---

## SOS Flow

1. User presses SOS button
2. Current location fetched
3. Emergency contacts notified
4. Incident logged
5. Authorities/guardians alerted

-------------------------------------------

## Incident Reporting Flow

1. User submits incident details
2. Backend validates data
3. Incident stored in database
4. Admin/system can review reports

----------------------------------------

# Example Backend Endpoints

## Authentication

```http
POST /login
POST /register
```

## SOS

```http
POST /sos
```

## Location

```http
POST /location
GET /location/<user_id>
```

## Contacts

```http
POST /contacts
GET /contacts
DELETE /contacts/<id>
```

## Incidents

```http
POST /incident
GET /incidents
```
